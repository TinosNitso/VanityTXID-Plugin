# VanityTXID-Plugin
Serious bug alert: only use with standard HD wallet (i.e. compressed keys)! v1.0.0 will burn coins if sent to uncompressed keys. Sorry! I'll get v1.0.1 out today, along with other bug fix/es.
Generate txn IDs starting with a specific pattern, using only a standard wallet + plugin. Currently only available for Electron Cash on Windows. Written in Python &amp; C++ for the miner.
