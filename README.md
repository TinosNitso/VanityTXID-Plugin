# VanityTXID-Plugin
Generate txn IDs starting with a specific pattern, using only a standard wallet + plugin. Currently only available for Electron Cash on Windows (BCH coin). Written in Python & C++ for the miner. To install the latest version you can just download "VanityTXID-Plugin.zip" above. Using this plugin you can also create and send SLP tokens with custom token/txn ID, like this PoW NFT: www.simpleledger.info/token/0000000f1393392b8de2cbf05e7a0ebc3d4630395e49a7c3f09174e46ce09da7

Latest release notes:
- Now support uncompressed keys. e.g. www.blockchain.com/bch/tx/000000821afbda9e137ab90bf5de3cad8bf8a3bbe218b7f9c26566ec5779fd8f
- Have improved UI with labels.
- Have fixed many error reports by using try:/except: functions. Crashes honestly never happened for me at first 'cause I was testing on portable EC - it depends on the EC edition whether try:/except: is really needed. e.g. non-portable EC no longer reports error on TaskKill.
- Found Python bitcoin.int_to_hex
- del(Password) after it's used.
- 128<Thread#<256 now allowed (was bug in C++ code). I've found 256 threads might be a tiny bit faster than 8 for patterns six long.

v1.0.0 simply blocked uncompressed keys from being used, without ever burning any coins. v1.0.1 now allows any keys!
