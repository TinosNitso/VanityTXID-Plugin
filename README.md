# VanityTXID-Plugin
Update: Earlier I reported a bug which I thought would burn coins of uncompressed keys, but that was wrong. v1.0.0 was safe after all! I did some tests and all coins were safe. I'll get v1.0.1 out today, which adds uncompressed key support along with other bug fixes.

Generate txn IDs starting with a specific pattern, using only a standard wallet + plugin. Currently only available for Electron Cash on Windows. Written in Python &amp; C++ for the miner.
